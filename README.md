# P2P Borrowing and Lending Protocol on PWR Chain

This project is a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) borrowing and lending protocol built on the PWR Chain, allowing users to borrow BTC or Ethereum using their Ordinals as collateral. Lenders can lend their BTC or Ethereum to earn interest (APY) on their Fusecoin, with rates that can go as high as 350%.

## Features

- **Borrowing**: Borrow BTC or Ethereum against your Ordinals.
- **Lending**: Lend out your BTC or Ethereum to earn interest on Fusecoin.
- **High Yield**: Potential Annual Percentage Yields (APYs) up to 350%.
- **Secure Smart Contracts**: All transactions are facilitated securely through smart contracts on the PWR Chain.
- **Collateral Management**: Ordinals are stored as collateral and can be retrieved by burning a bridge NFT from the PWR Chain smart contracts.
